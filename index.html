      <h3>Speech</h3>
      <p>Good afternoon everyone,
My name is Cleidy Gomez, and I am running to be the Mayor of New York City from 2025 to 2029 and to become the first ever female mayor of NYC.
I am a 32 year old Dominican and Honduran woman, born and raised right here in Queens, New York City. I had the honor of serving as an assistant to former Mayor Bill de Blasio, where I aided him in scoping out political affairs and learned firsthand how leadership can shape our great city.
My campaign is built on three core ideologies, the principles I stand for and will fight for every single day.
First, the protection of civil rights. I will strive to improve the perception and acceptance of those who wish to come out, and to ensure that the rights of those who already have are maintained and enforced. Every New Yorker deserves to live freely, proudly, and equally under the law.
Second, regulating and boosting the economy. With NYC currently facing an economic crisis, housing costs increasing, an “F” grade in taxpayer burden, and the highest individual income tax ranking first out of all 51 states, I will work tirelessly to stabilize our economy and lower the rapidly increasing housing costs. New York should be a city where everyone can afford to live, not just survive.
And third, environmental awareness. Our city is quickly rising in the ranks of pollution compared to the rest of the states, and I intend to stop that gradually, responsibly, and effectively. No big changes can be made overnight, but throughout my tenure as Mayor, we will see consistent, meaningful progress toward a cleaner, greener New York.
I am determined to combat these three main issues, civil rights, economic stability, and environmental awareness whether or not I’m elected mayor. With the help of the allies and connections I’ve made throughout our community, we can achieve this together.
And I assure you I am the right choice for this position. I will not slack off in this role. I won’t be sitting in the office reading or playing CoolMathGames while giving a speech. I won’t be using prohibited devices while documenting my candidacy. I will be working for you, with you, and alongside you.
With the support of my dedicated interest groups, N.O.W. (National Organization of Women), N.Y.G.I.C. (New York Green Industry Council), N.W.Y.F. (New York Women’s Foundation), the faculty of our schools, and of course, you the citizens I will make a “Newer New York.”
So if you want a representative who will protect your rights, rebuild our economy, and restore our environment , then Vote N.O.W. for Cleidy, Mayor of NYC, and together, we will make a “Newer, New York!”
Thank you.
